# urbanMicroclimateFoam

An open-source solver for coupled physical processes modeling urban microclimate based on OpenFOAM. Based on original [contributions](https://gitlab.ethz.ch/openfoam-cbp/solvers/urbanmicroclimatefoam) from ETH researchers.

> urbanMicroclimateFoam is a multi-region solver consisting of an air subdomain together with subdomains for porous urban building materials. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model solves the turbulent, convective airflow and heat and moisture transport in the air subdomain. A coupled heat and moisture (HAM) transport model solves the absorption, transport, and storage of heat and moisture in porous building materials. A radiation model determines the net longwave and shortwave radiative heat fluxes for each surface using a view factor approach.
